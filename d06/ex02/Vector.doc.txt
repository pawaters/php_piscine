<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
A vector is a way to represent a movement. 
INPUT: two vertices:
        a) Destination: ($array['dest']) which is mandatory
		b) Origin: ($array['orig']) which defaults to (0,0,0,1) when not given.

The class has the following methods on top of the standard ones of previous classes:

float magnitude();
Returns the length of the vector. formula =√(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)

Vector normalize();
take the vector, keep it pointing in same direction, change length to 1.
If the vector is already normalized, it returns a fresh copy of the vector.

Vector add( Vector $rhs );
Returns the sum of both vectors.

Vector sub( Vector $rhs );
Returns the difference vector of both vectors.

Vector opposite();
Returns the opposite vector.

Vector scalarProduct( $k );
Returns the scalar multiplication of both vectors.

float dotProduct( Vector $rhs );
Returns the multiplication of the vector with a scalar.

float cos( Vector $rhs );
Returns the cosine of the angle between the two vectors.

Vector crossProduct( Vector $rhs);
Returns the cross multiplication of both vectors (right-hand system).

**Note: this class will not have any setters, only getters.
